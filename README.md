# üìß Phishing Investigation ‚Äì PowerCat Reverse Shell

This project documents my hands-on investigation of a simulated phishing alert from TryHackMe. The scenario involved a malicious ZIP file disguised as an invoice, ultimately leading to the discovery of a PowerShell reverse shell payload using **PowerCat**.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Summary

- **Data Source**: Email
- **Recipient**: Michael Ascot (CEO)
- **Attachment**: `ImportantInvoice-Febrary.zip`
- **Host**: 3450
- **Malware Type**: Reverse Shell (PowerCat)
- **Tools Used**: PowerShell, VirusTotal, TryDetectThis, Splunk

## üß™ Steps Taken

1. **Initial Triage**
   - Identified misspellings in the subject and attachment (`Invioce`, `Febrary`)
   - Flagged as suspicious due to social engineering and poor grammar

2. **File Extraction & Analysis**
   - Extracted `.zip` archive: contained a disguised `.LNK` (shortcut) file
   - Used PowerShell's `more` function to read contents
   - Discovered embedded PowerShell script executing **PowerCat**

3. **Hash Reputation Check**
   - Generated file hashes using `TryDetectThis`
   - No results found on **VirusTotal**

4. **Splunk Correlation**
   - Host `3450` (assigned to CEO) was searched via Splunk
   - Found matching PowerShell script activity in logs ‚Äì confirmed execution

## üîç Key Findings

- **Threat Vector**: Phishing email with compressed shortcut file
- **Payload**: PowerCat reverse shell enabling remote access
- **Persistence Risk**: Bypasses some AV tools due to use of native PowerShell

## üöß Lessons Learned

- File extensions can be misleading ‚Äì always inspect deeply
- PowerShell abuse is still common and effective
- Endpoint visibility (via Splunk) is critical for full detection
- Reverse shells can be hidden in seemingly simple attachments

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Email threat analysis
- File hash generation and malware triage
- PowerShell script inspection
- Host-level investigation using Splunk
- Threat hunting and IOC identification
